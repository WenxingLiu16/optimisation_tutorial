# OpEn Python Examples

- All the subfolders are examples using Python Rust interface for various optimisation problems. 

- Briefly speaking, you need to make a python file for **code generation (for solver)**, and another for **calling the solver**. For details, you need to read [this](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/python-interface).

- For OpEn Python Interface, you need to have **Python version 3.5 or newer** (See [this](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation#python-interface) for details)
